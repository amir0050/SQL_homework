Okay, let's go through these fundamental database concepts and SQL Server specifics in English.
Definitions:

Data:

Definition: Data refers to raw, unorganized facts, figures, symbols, or observations. By itself, data may not have specific meaning until it is processed or interpreted.
Example: 123, John Doe, 2023-10-26, an image of a cat, a temperature reading of 25°C.
Database:

Definition: A database (DB) is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. It is managed so that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Databases are designed for efficient storage and retrieval of information.
Example: A contact list on your phone, an inventory catalog for an online store, a student record system for a university.
Relational Database:

Definition: A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. Data in a relational database is organized into tables (also called relations), which consist of rows (records) and columns (attributes). Relationships between tables are established using keys (primary and foreign keys).
Example: A database where one table stores customer information, and another table stores their orders, with these tables linked by a customer ID. SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle Database are examples of relational database management systems (RDBMS).
Table:

Definition: In the context of relational databases, a table is the fundamental structure for storing data. It consists of rows (records or tuples) and columns (fields or attributes). Each column has a name and a data type, and each row represents a single set of related values for those columns.
Example: A Students table might have columns StudentID, Name, and Age, and rows where each row is information about a specific student: (1, 'Alice Smith', 20).

Five Key Features of SQL Server:

Scalability and Performance: SQL Server can handle large volumes of data and high workloads, offering various editions and features (e.g., partitioning, indexing, In-Memory OLTP) to optimize performance.
High Availability and Disaster Recovery: It provides robust solutions like Always On Availability Groups, Always On Failover Cluster Instances, and backup and restore mechanisms to ensure business continuity.
Security: SQL Server includes strong security features such as authentication (Windows and SQL Server), role-based authorization, data encryption (TDE, Always Encrypted), auditing, and data masking.
Business Intelligence Integration: It offers deep integration with Microsoft BI tools like SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) for OLAP, SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) for reports, and SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) for ETL processes.
Advanced T-SQL Programmability: Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is Microsoft's powerful extension to SQL, allowing for the creation of complex stored procedures, functions, triggers, and the use of advanced language constructs for data manipulation and business logic.

Different Authentication Modes in SQL Server:

Windows Authentication Mode:
Users connect to SQL Server using their Windows login credentials. SQL Server trusts the authentication performed by the Windows operating system.
This is generally considered more secure as it doesn't require sending passwords over the network (if Kerberos is configured correctly) and allows for centralized user management via Active Directory.
SQL Server and Windows Authentication Mode (Mixed Mode):
Allows connections using both Windows credentials and SQL Server logins (usernames and passwords created directly within SQL Server).
SQL Server Authentication is useful for applications running on non-Windows platforms, for legacy applications that don't support Windows authentication, or in environments without a domain infrastructure.

Create a new database in SSMS named SchoolDB:
Method 1: Using SSMS GUI

Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and connect to your SQL Server instance.
In Object Explorer, right-click on the Databases folder.

Select New Database….
In the Database name: field, type SchoolDB.
Leave other settings as default (or configure them if needed, like file paths for data and log files).
Click OK.

Method 2: Using T-SQL Query
Open a new query window in SSMS ("New Query" button) and execute:
CREATE DATABASE SchoolDB;

Write and execute a query to create a table called Students:
First, ensure you are in the context of the SchoolDB database:
USE SchoolDB;
GO -- GO is not a T-SQL command; it's a batch separator for SSMS/sqlcmd utilities

CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- Name should not be empty
    Age INT
);
GO

To execute:

Open a new query window in SSMS.
Copy and paste this code.
Click the "Execute" button (or press F5).

Differences between SQL Server, SSMS, and SQL:

SQL (Structured Query Language):

This is the programming language used to communicate with relational databases. SQL allows you to define data structures (DDL), manipulate data (DML), query data (DQL), and control data access (DCL). It's a standard, but many RDBMSs (including SQL Server) have their own dialects (e.g., T-SQL for SQL Server).
Analogy: The language (e.g., English) you use to give commands.
SQL Server (Microsoft SQL Server):

This is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft. It's the software (the server) that actually stores the data, processes SQL queries, ensures security, handles backups, and performs many other database management functions.
Analogy: The engine and all the mechanics of a car that do the work.
SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio):

This is an integrated development environment (IDE) or graphical tool provided by Microsoft for managing SQL Server instances. Using SSMS, administrators and developers can write and execute SQL queries, design databases, configure security, manage backups, monitor performance, etc.
Analogy: The dashboard, steering wheel, and pedals of a car through which you control the engine.

In short: You use SSMS (the tool) to write SQL (the language) to give commands to SQL Server (the database management system).
Different SQL Commands: DQL, DML, DDL, DCL, TCL with examples:

DQL (Data Query Language): Used to retrieve data from the database.

Main command: SELECT
Example:
sql
SELECT Name, Age FROM Students WHERE Age > 18;

(Selects the names and ages of students older than 18.)
DML (Data Manipulation Language): Used to add, delete, and modify data in the database.

Commands: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
Examples:
-- Add a new student
INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, Name, Age) VALUES (1, 'Alice Smith', 20);

-- Update the age of the student with ID = 1
UPDATE Students SET Age = 21 WHERE StudentID = 1;

-- Delete the student with ID = 1
DELETE FROM Students WHERE StudentID = 1;

DDL (Data Definition Language): Used to define and manage the structure of database objects.

Commands: CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME
Examples:
-- Create a new table
CREATE TABLE Courses (
    CourseID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CourseName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Credits INT
);

-- Add a new column to the Students table
ALTER TABLE Students ADD Email VARCHAR(100);

-- Delete the Courses table
DROP TABLE Courses;

-- Remove all rows from the Students table (faster than DELETE, doesn't log each row)
TRUNCATE TABLE Students;

DCL (Data Control Language): Used to manage access rights to data and database objects.

Commands: GRANT, REVOKE
Examples:
-- Give 'User1' permission to select data from the Students table
GRANT SELECT ON Students TO User1;

-- Take away 'User1's permission to insert data into the Students table
REVOKE INSERT ON Students FROM User1;

TCL (Transaction Control Language): Used to manage transactions in the database, ensuring their atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties).

Commands: COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT, BEGIN TRANSACTION
Examples:
BEGIN TRANSACTION; -- Start a transaction
INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, Name, Age) VALUES (2, 'Bob Johnson', 22);
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 100 WHERE UserID = 2;

Amir, [11.05.2025 18:51]
-- If everything is successful:
COMMIT; -- Apply the changes

-- If something went wrong:
-- ROLLBACK; -- Undo the changes

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, Name, Age) VALUES (3, 'Carol Williams', 19);
SAVEPOINT StudentAdded; -- Create a savepoint
UPDATE Grades SET Grade = 'A' WHERE StudentID = 3 AND CourseID = 101;
-- If the grade update fails, you can roll back to the savepoint:
-- ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT StudentAdded;
COMMIT;


Write a query to insert three records into the Students table:
Ensure you are in the context of the SchoolDB database.
USE SchoolDB;
GO

INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, Name, Age) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 20);
INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, Name, Age) VALUES (2, 'Jane Smith', 19);
INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, Name, Age) VALUES (3, 'Peter Jones', 21);
GO

-- To verify, you can execute:
SELECT * FROM Students;

Alternatively, you can insert multiple rows with a single INSERT statement:
USE SchoolDB;
GO

INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, Name, Age) VALUES
(4, 'Emily Brown', 22),
(5, 'Michael Davis', 20),
(6, 'Sarah Wilson', 19);
GO

-- To verify, you can execute:
SELECT * FROM Students;

When running the second block, make sure StudentIDs 4, 5, and 6 don't already exist if you've run the first INSERT for IDs 1, 2, 3, as StudentID is a primary key and must be unique.
